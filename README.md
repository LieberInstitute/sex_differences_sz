# LIBD Sex Differences in Schizophrenia

**Abstract**<br>
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic features, including 
differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male incidence rate. Prior large-scale 
transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia have focused on the prefrontal cortex. 
Analyzing BrainSeq Consortium data (caudate nucleus: n = 399, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: 
n = 377, and hippocampus: n = 394), we identified 831 unique genes that exhibit sex differences 
across brain regions, enriched for immune-related pathways. We observed X-chromosome dosage 
reduction in the hippocampus of male individuals with schizophrenia. Our sex interaction model 
revealed 148 junctions dysregulated in a sex-specific manner in schizophrenia. Sex-specific 
schizophrenia analysis identified dozens of differentially expressed genes, notably enriched in 
immune-related pathways. Finally, our sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci analysis 
revealed 704 unique genes, nine associated with schizophrenia risk. These findings emphasize the 
importance of sex-informed analysis of sexually dimorphic traits, inform personalized therapeutic 
strategies in schizophrenia, and highlight the need for increased female samples for schizophrenia 
analyses.
