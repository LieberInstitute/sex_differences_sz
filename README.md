# LIBD Sex Differences in Schizophrenia

**Abstract**<br>
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic
features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and
male incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been studied in
large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia.
Here, we examined the BrainSeq Consortium RNA-sequencing and genotypes for
the caudate nucleus (n=399), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; n=377),
and hippocampus (n=394) to characterize sex differences in schizophrenia.
We identified genomic features (genes, transcripts, exons, and exon-exon
junctions) associated with sex, sex-specific expression in schizophrenia,
and sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (si-eQTL) associated
with schizophrenia risk. We found 831 unique genes that exhibit sex
differences across brain regions, enriched for immune-related pathways.
X-chromosome dosage was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of male
individuals with schizophrenia. Our sex interaction model revealed 148
junctions dysregulated for schizophrenia in a sex-specific manner.
Sex-specific schizophrenia analysis identified dozens of expressed,
sex-specific features also with enrichment in immune-related pathways.
Finally, our si-eQTL analysis revealed 704 unique genes, nine of which
are associated with schizophrenia risk. Overall, our results increased
the number of annotated sex-biased features, identified sex-specific
schizophrenia genes, and provided the first annotation of si-eQTL in
the human DLPFC and hippocampus. Altogether, these results point to the
importance of sex-informed analysis of sexually dimorphic traits, inform
personalized therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia, and highlight the
need for increased female samples for schizophrenia analyses.
